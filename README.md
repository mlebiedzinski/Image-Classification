CS 4100 Artificial Intelliegence
April 2023

This project entails multiclass image classification using a convolutional neural networks. The programâ€™s goal is to differentiate unique hand symbols to be rock, paper, or scissors.  Tensorflow is utilized to create the CNN architecture, and the data set used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.
